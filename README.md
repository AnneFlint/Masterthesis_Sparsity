# Masterthesis_Sparsity
This the code for the experiments conducted in my masters thesis.

Title: Modelling sparsity in deep neural networks - application to health care data. 
Joint Masters programme in Health Informatics (Karolinska Insitutet and Stockholm University).

A simple, one layer CNN architecture was trained on one pathology from the CheXpert (https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) database.
Afterwards, magnitude pruning and L1 regularization were applied. Both are included in Tensorflow. 

Code was validated on the MNIST dataset.
